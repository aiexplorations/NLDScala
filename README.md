Nonlinear dynamical systems analysis using Scala. Currently there's functionality to find fixed points for univariate functions. 
Some ideas for future development are:

* Parameter exploration
* Understanding the onset of chaos
* Fractal generator / explorer
* Logistic map and bifurcation diagrams

Suggestions and comments welcome!
